Davis Dining Commons

This website allows users to view the menus of all the dining commons of UC Davis 
without the need to go to four different websites to look at the different menus.

There is a also a dropdown menu on the left which allows the user to select filters
depending on their dietary restrictions. After the filter is applied, the food items
containing the restriction will not be shown.
